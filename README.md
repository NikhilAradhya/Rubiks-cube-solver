Hey, I love logic...

Come on, lets make a Rubik's cube solver from scratch!!, This will surely be a treat for all cuboholics and programming minds!!
We shall plan for a robot with 6 arms for 6 faces which are controlled by stepper motors, we shall implement this on an Arduino MEGA development board. We shall  also plan for an android app for the input part, i.e., taking the cube's picture and sening the input (colours of various places) through wifi.
